      <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence, or known as emotional quotient (EQ) is a human
        ability to understand, use and manage our own emotions and understand
        the emotions of people around us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Daniel Goleman, a science journalist introduced and outlined five main
        emotional intelligence constructs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Self-awareness - Accurate emotional self-awareness, understanding
            and recognizing one's own emotions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Self-regulation - Maintaining positive and appropriate control over
            emotions, ensuring emotional expression is manageable and not out of
            control.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Social skill - The capacity to objectively and accurately assess
            resources, strengths, weaknesses, and realities in a given
            environment.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Empathy - Strong empathetic abilities, being attuned to subtle
            signals and sensitively understanding the needs, desires, and
            emotions of others.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Motivation - The ability to harness emotions to achieve
            self-motivation and accomplish goals.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Now that we know what Emotional Intelligence is, why do we need it in
        the tech industry? Isn't IQ more important?
      </p>
      <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
      <p>Let's find out the difference between EQ and IQ in the table:</p>
      <table style="width: 100%">

          <td>

            manage our own emotions and understand the emotions of people around
            us.
          </td>
          <td>
            Intelligence quotient (IQ) is a score that indicates a human's
            intelligence by several standardized tests.

      <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
      <p>
        Let's answer this question. In today's society, characterized by intense
        competition and challenges, an individual's abilities alone are
        insufficient to achieve significant goals. Collaboration and teamwork
        are crucial, especially in the tech industry.
      </p>
      <p>Why?</p>
      <p>
        This can be attributed to Moore's Law, which observes that the number of
        transistors in an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two
        years. As both integrated circuits and software development continue to
        rapidly evolve, it becomes nearly impossible for an individual to
        acquire all the necessary knowledge. Therefore, teamwork becomes
        essential.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike IQ, which is innate, EQ can be developed and trained. By
        cultivating our EQ, we become more adept at managing our emotions and
        better equipped to perceive and understand the emotions of others. This
        enables us to work together effectively, comprehend others'
        perspectives, and offer mutual support, ultimately leading to greater
        success.
