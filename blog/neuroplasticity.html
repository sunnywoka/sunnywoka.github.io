      <h2 class="page-title">Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>
      <h2>What is the Neuroplasticity?</h2>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is one of the magical abilities in our brain to change
        and adapt due to experience. We can observe these changes in both
        functional and structural aspects. Functional changes occur as a result
        of brain damage, where functions are relocated from the damaged part to
        the undamaged part. On the other hand, structural changes refer to the
        brain's ability to physically alter its structure through learning. In
        this topic, I will primarily focus on structural plasticity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why do we need to understand neuroplasticity in our learning? The answer
        is quite obvious: it can bring significant benefits to us! Here are some
        of the benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Improvements that can boost brain health.</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>Strengthening brain where function is lost or has declined</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>The ability to enhance existing cognitive capabilities</p></li>
        <li><p>The ability to learn new things</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You may ask, "You told me about the benefits of neuroplasticity, but how
        can I improve it in my brain?" Yes, there are several ways to enhance
        it!
      </p>
      <p>
        First of all, the most important thing is to allow your brain to get
        enough rest. Getting a good night's sleep has positive effects on both
        physical and mental health. Moreover, sleep plays an important role in
        brain growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, we can maintain regular exercise. Some research has found that
        exercise may help prevent neuron loss in key areas of our brain and
        plays an important role in the formation of new neurons in the same
        region.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last way we can approach this is through mindfulness practice.
        Instead of engaging in physical exercise, we can simply close our eyes
        and imagine ourselves practicing and cultivating mindfulness. This
        practice can also enhance our brain's neuroplasticity.

        of the knowledge:

      <h2>What is the Growth Mindset?</h2>
      <p>
        A growth mindset is a way of viewing challenges and setbacks. People
        with a growth mindset strongly believe that their skills and abilities
        can develop and improve over time, even when they face difficulties with
        certain skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        A growth mindset is highly relevant to our learning, especially in the
        rapidly evolving field of IT. With technology advancing at a rapid pace,
        it is nearly impossible for any individual to master all of the skills
        and knowledge within the IT industry. As a programmer, it is crucial to
        recognise that growth and adaptation are essential in this industry, and
        both work and life may not always be smooth or without challenges.Having
        a growth mindset can be immensely beneficial in overcoming difficulties
        and maintaining a positive attitude. It helps us embrace the learning
        process, view setbacks as opportunities for growth, and stay motivated
        even when faced with obstacles.
      </p>
      <p>
        The TED speech titled "The Power of Believing That You Can Improve" by
        psychologist Carol Dweck definitely surprised me because her theory, the
        power of 'not yet', gave me a new idea about how to approach
        difficulties. I used to have a tendency to doubt or question myself when
        I struggled with a problem, wondering if I could ever master new skills
        and acquire knowledge. However, the power of 'not yet' reassured me that
        I can achieve it in the future; I simply haven't reached that point of
        readiness yet. Moreover, it taught me how to encourage others when they
        encounter obstacles.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the growth mindset emerged in my learning journey, I realised its
        tremendous usefulness. It not only provides me with encouragement when I
        face challenges, but also teaches me how to support and collaborate with
        my groupmates in larger projects during the Bootcamp.

      <h2>How do they influence my learning plan and strategy?</h2>
      <p>
        After learning about the concept of neuroplasticity and growth mindset,
        my learning plan has undergone some slight changes. I have come to
        realize the importance of incorporating regular exercise into my daily
        routine. I have also recognized the value of taking breaks and engaging
        in mindful practice to enhance my technical skills. Consequently, I have
        decided to allocate more time to these activities instead of solely
        focusing on repetitive exercise.
