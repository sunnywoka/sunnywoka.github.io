      <h2>Damn! I was blocked on a simple problem</h2>
      <p>
        I stuck in question 7 'STRETCH MATERIAL' in the
        <code>4-gradebook</code> challenge for nearly an hour. The question
        asked me to complete a function which takes 3 parameters:
        <code>gradebook</code>(it is an empty object), <code>students</code>(it
        is an array) and <code>scores</code>(it is an array). This was my first
        answer:
      </p>
      <pre>

        function enterScores(gradebook, students, scores) {
          for (let i = 0; i < students[i]; i++) {
            gradebook[students[i]] = {}
          }
          for (let i = 0; i < students[i]; i++) {
            gradebook[students[i]]['testScores'] = scores[i]
          }
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        If you are good with details and have deep understanding of for loop, I
        think you have already figured out where the problem is, LOL. When I ran
        the test in the terminal, it returned the error message:
        <code>'TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined'</code> with an
        arrow pointing to the position under the code
        <code>['testScores']</code> in the second loop. I searched for the error
        message on Google, and there were many examples explaining how to solve
        this issue. However, none of them were the same or similar to my code. I
        believe the problem lies in the incorrect syntax of the code on this
        line:
      </p>
      <pre>

        gradebook[students[i]]['testScores'] = scores[i]
      </pre>
      <p>I tried other syntaxes of this code:</p>
      <pre>

        gradebook.students[i].['testScores'] = scores[i]
      </pre>
      <pre>

        gradebook.students[i].testScores. = scores[i]
      </pre>
      <p>
        Yup, none of them could solve the problem. I was stuck in this rabbit
        hole. Then, I took a break and decided to use the rubber ducky method to
        review my solution and the code. The first time I talked to the duck, I
        realized that the error was not in this code, and the problem should be
        somewhere else. I wrote console.log in each for loop and read the logs
        in the console. Finally, I found the silly mistake inside the conditions
        in the for loop. The condition <code>i < students[i]</code> was
        incorrect and should be <code>i < students.length</code>. Here is the
        correct anwser:
      </p>
      <pre>

        function enterScores(gradebook, students, scores) {
          for (let i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {
            gradebook[students[i]] = {}
          }
          for (let i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {
            gradebook[students[i]]['testScores'] = scores[i]
          }
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        After solving this problem, I did feel very sheepish for making such a
        silly mistake. However, on the other hand, I was proud of myself for
        trying new and easier problem-solving techniques to address the issue. I
        also learned that I should try different techniques to solve a problem
        instead of relying on just one approach. Moreover, I realized the
        importance of taking a break and coming back to the problem with a fresh
        perspective.
      </p>
      <h2>Yeah! I elegantly solved a problem</h2>
      <p>
        The first time I felt I elegantly solved a problem was in the
        <code>3-super-fizzbuzz</code> challenge. The challenge required writing
        two functions: one that would return the number passed to it, but if the
        number was divisible by <code>15</code>, it would return the string
        <code>FizzBuzz</code>; if the number was divisible by <code>5</code>, it
        would return the string <code>Buzz</code>; and if the number was
        divisible by <code>3</code>, it would return the string
        <code>Fizz</code>. The other function would take an array of numbers as
        input, loop over the array, and return a new array applying the fizzbuzz
        rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        To solve this problem, I used the rubber ducky method, talking myself
        through what I needed to do. For the first function, since there were
        four conditions, I decided to use an
        <code>if - else if - else</code> statement to implement it. For the
        second function, I used a for loop to iterate over the numbers in the
        array and called the first function to apply the fizzbuzz rules. Then, I
        wrote pseudocode to demonstrate my plan:
      </p>
      <pre>

        //function one
        //function with a number parameter
        //if statement: the number is dicisible by 15, return the string FizzBuzz
        //else if statement: the number is dicisible by 5, return the string Buzz
        //else if statement: the number is dicisible by 3, return the string Fizz
        //else statement: just return the number parameter

        //function two
        //function with an array of numbers
        //declare an empty array
        //for statement
        //call function one with a parameter of the number in the array
        //add the returned number into the empty array
        //return the new array
      </pre>
      <p>
        Using these two methods, generating a plan and organising the solution
        before writing actual code, felt like a game-changer. It made the
        programming process feel easier and more manageable. I learned that
        early planning and organising ideas and solutions can save a lot of work
        and make the entire task more effective. It's a valuable lesson in terms
        of improving productivity and efficiency in programming.
      </p>
      <h2>How do I feel using the problem-solving techniques or processes?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Pseudocode:</h3>
          <p>
            It is one of the best technique to improve productivity and
            efficiency in programming. I think it will be great to use this
            method before writing the codes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Rubber ducky method:</h3>
          <p>
            It is another good method to generating a plan and organising the
            ideas before writing actual code. It looks like a bit nonsense, but
            it also a great method to improve the ability of neuroplasticity of
            brain.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Reading error messages:</h3>
          <p>
            This method can be useful in detecting various errors, such as
            misspellings, missing punctuation, and incorrect syntax. While error
            messages like
            <code>TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined</code> can
            provide hints about the location of the error, it is still necessary
            to identify and correct the mistakes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Console.logging:</h3>
          <p>
            It is a simple and effective method for dealing with problems. It
            can provide information about function returns, check if an object
            is empty, and determine the index of an array, among other things.
            It is a clear and straightforward approach to debugging a program.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Googling and Trying something:</h3>
          <p>
            These two methods can be either useful or useless. Technical sites
            like MDN and W3Schools can provide definitions and examples for my
            search. However, the examples may be too simplistic to apply to my
            program. Additionally, websites like Stack Overflow may offer
            solutions that rely on different system environments, tech setups,
            or programming language versions, which can further complicate the
            problem. Also, tring something without clues may make the problem
            more puzzling.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Asking peers or coaches for help:</h3>
          <p>
            I have not yet sought help from peers or coaches, but it remains the
            best method to solve the problem. There's no need to feel
            embarrassed about it. Also, seeking help can improve connections
            within the group.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Improving your process with reflection:</h3>
          <p>
            Reflecting on mistakes and problems can help the brain memorize the
            solutions. It can also leave a strong impression, enabling the brain
            to quickly recall the information when faced with the same or
            similar problem.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What can I try differently when I was reluctant to ask for help?</h2>
      <p>
        I haven't asked for help in the foundation course yet for two reasons.
        Firstly, the most challenging questions have already been asked and
        solved in Discord channel, so I have been observing and learning from
        those discussions. Secondly, I tend to prefer seeking help towards the
        end, after I have exhausted all possible methods on my own. In the case
        of question 7 'STRETCH MATERIAL' in the
        <code>4-gradebook</code> challenge, I actually identified the error just
        before deciding to ask for help in the Discord channel. Since it was an
        individual challenge, I felt it was acceptable to hesitate in seeking
        assistance. However, I recognise the need to change this approach and be
        more proactive in asking for help in the future, especially when working
        on larger group projects, as it can be more effective.
