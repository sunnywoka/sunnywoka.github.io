      <p>Hello World, my name is Yuekai. Thank you for visiting my blog.</p>
      <p>I am excited to introduce my journey in Dev Academy</p>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm Yuekai, a dynamic full-stack web developer with a deep-seated
        passion for problem-solving and a knack for seamless team collaboration.
        I thrive in fast-paced, challenging environments and eagerly anticipate
        the next exciting project.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey through Dev Academy provided me with intensive training in
        both technical prowess and essential interpersonal skills. Over 17
        weeks, the most invaluable lesson I gleaned was the profound impact of
        teamwork. It became evident that true success is a collective endeavour,
        rather than the solitary pursuit of a single developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        My professional background includes serving as a team member and manager
        in a bustling café setting, attesting to my adeptness at fostering
        synergy and unity towards common objectives. I firmly believe in the
        fusion of productivity and enjoyment in the workplace, maintaining a
        steadfast work ethic while cherishing the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        I look forward to bringing this collaborative spirit and problem-solving
        prowess to future endeavours, tackling challenges head-on with a
        passionate drive for excellence.
      </p>
