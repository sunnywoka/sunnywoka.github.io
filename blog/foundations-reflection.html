      <h2 class="page-title">Core Reflection</h2>
      <h2>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        By learning about neuroplasticity, growth mindset, and the
        self-regulation aspect of emotional intelligence (EQ), I have gained a
        deeper understanding of myself. Neuroplasticity has shown me that my
        brain can undergo positive changes through continuous study and
        practice. The growth mindset has provided encouragement to persevere in
        learning and ultimately overcome challenges. The self-regulation
        component of EQ has taught me how to maintain positive and appropriate
        control over my emotions, ensuring that my emotional expression remains
        manageable and not out of control.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I believe that values, empathy, and self-awareness play a crucial role
        in helping me navigate challenges, difficulties, and frustrations. Also,
        they contribute to effective collaboration and create a friendly team
        environment.
      </p>
      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        I was extremely surprised when I learned about the concept of
        neuroplasticity and growth mindset because they provided me with the
        understanding of why I should continue practicing and how learning can
        create positive and permanent changes in the brain. It gave me the
        motivation to keep learning. Moreover, the growth mindset encourages me
        not to worry about challenges. The difficulty doesn't arise because I
        cannot overcome it, but rather because I am not ready for it yet.
      </p>
      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        The most challenging aspect for me was considering my identity and my
        value because I had never deeply considered them before the Foundation.
        It took me a lot of time to reach a conclusion about them.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Because the power of a single person is too small in the real tech
        industry world, bigger success requires people working as a team and
        collaborating. Therefore, human skills are essential. We need to know
        ourselves, know our workmates, and know how to work together
      </p>
      <h2>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p>
        No, I never feel that studying core is a waste of time, and I am happy
        with the balance between tech and core. As I mentioned previously, the
        power of a single person is too small in the real tech industry world.
        Bigger success requires people working as a team and collaborating. The
        core is essential for work.
