      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        My long-term goal is to become a full-stack developer with a strong
        teamwork spirit. Although I graduated from university with a computer
        science degree, I have realized that I lack real-world project
        experience and teamwork skills. That's why I have decided to sharpen my
        skills and cultivate a learning habit by joining Bootcamp with Dev
        Academy. Once I enter the tech industry, I understand the importance of
        continuously learning new technologies and improving myself
        incrementally. I am committed to staying updated with the latest
        advancements and embracing a lifelong learning mindset. By doing so, I
        aim to progress steadily and become a highly skilled and adaptable
        developer.
      </p>
      <h2>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h2>
      <p>
        I consider myself a fast learner, capable of absorbing knowledge and
        retaining it effectively. During the first two Sprints, I quickly grasp
        the challenging concepts and can draw connections to other cases based
        on a single instance. Moreover, I enjoy critical thinking and the
        questions in the Core part, constantly seeking ways to improve. However,
        I must admit that I struggle with laziness and easily get distracted by
        video games. My time management skills also are poor. To overcome these
        limitations, I am trying to implement certain strategies. I make plans
        in the morning, rewarding myself upon achieving daily goals, and
        striving to develop a habit of consistent studying. These efforts are
        aimed at addressing my weaknesses and fostering positive habits for
        personal growth.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I would like to improve my teamwork skills, communication skills, and
        asking-for-help skills, as I consider them essential for becoming a
        great developer in a team. Sometimes, I find myself being too
        individualistic, which is not a favourable trait in the tech industry.
        It is crucial for us to work together and contribute to achieving
        significant success.
      </p>
      <h2>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I usually take a quick look at the entire workload of the sprint on
        Monday. Then, I divide the work into five or six days and create my
        daily plan each morning.
      </p>
      <h2>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h2>
      <p>
        It's wonderful that I've joined the big family at Dev Academy! I've
        joined the Discord channel where I can have meetings with my home
        groupmates and facilitators. Furthermore, I can seek answers to any
        existing questions or ask for help on the Discord channel at any time.
      </p>
      <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
      <p>
        I would expect the Facilitation team to share their tips, experiences,
        and stories from the real tech industry. I believe that such insights
        would greatly assist us in becoming great developers, just like them.
        Learning from their expertise can provide valuable guidance and
        inspiration for our own journeys in the tech industry.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Good news! My wife is pregnant and we will have our first baby at the
        end of this year! Because she is new to New Zealand, I need to look
        after her and take her to visit the midwife and take the pregnancy
        service together. I will ask for half a day off for each maternity care
        service during the Bootcamp.

      <h2 class="page-title">My Learning Plan in Bootcamp</h2>
      <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        My long-term goal remains to become a full-stack developer in the
        future. Throughout my journey in the Foundation, I have learned both
        technical skills and core skills. I now understand that becoming a great
        programmer requires not only practicing programming but also developing
        essential human skills. With this realisation, I am determined to
        continue learning and honing both sets of skills during my bootcamp
        studies. I believe this will serve as a solid foundation for my career
        pathway, allowing me to cultivate positive habits that will make me a
        better programmer. As I leave Dev Academy, I am confident that these
        habits will continue to enhance my abilities and contribute to my
        continuous growth in the future.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I still believe my biggest strength is that I am a quick learner. I can
        absorb knowledge quickly and apply it to challenges. Also, I have good
        problem-solving skills, such as searching the question in Google.
        However, my weakness lies in my communication skills. I feel embarrassed
        to ask questions, and English being my second language makes me worried
        about making mistakes. Furthermore, I tend to compare myself to others,
        which sometimes leads to feelings of anxiety.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h2>
      <p>
        My biggest challenges are improving my communication skills and
        enhancing self-regulation. As mentioned earlier, I feel embarrassed to
        ask questions, and being English my second language, I worry about
        making mistakes. Moreover, I struggle with self-regulation, easily
        getting distracted by non-important things and often leaving tasks until
        the last minute due to poor time management.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I definitely want to improve my communication skills as I believe it is
        the most important skill to work in a team. Moreover, I would like to
        improve my self-regulation in keeping studying and practicing the
        program, as it is another essential skill to become a good developer.
      </p>
      <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
      <p>
        Definitely, I wish to have both technical and emotional support from The
        Bootcamp team. Additionally, I am looking forward to receiving
        professional suggestions and tips for working effectively in a team in
        the future.
      </p>
      <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
      <p>
        I have many expectations of myself. I wish I can learn and apply more
        JavaScript knowledge, explore popular technologies and framework in the
        tech industry, communicate actively with all classmates and
        facilitators, and most importantly, have fun and enjoy the Bootcamp!
