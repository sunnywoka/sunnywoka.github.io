      <h2>What is JavaScript and what is its relationship to HTML and CSS?</h2>
      <p>
        In web development, HTML defines the structure of your content, CSS
        determines the style and layout, and JavaScript makes the content
        interactive. None of them are dispensable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's consider that building a good-looking and fully functional website
        is like building your dream car. The first step is to build the frame of
        the car, and your friend, Mr. HTML, helps you with it. Then, you want
        your dream car to be unique! Your other friend, Ms. CSS, adds color with
        hex digits to the car's frame, designs special big fancy rims, new-tech
        LED headlights, and more. Cool! Your car looks awesome!
      </p>
      <p>
        You decide to show off your car, but wait, there's no engine! No brakes!
        No transmission! All of the functional parts are missing. Right now,
        it's just a good-looking car frame! Luckily, Mr. HTML and Ms. CSS
        introduce their friend, Mr. JavaScript, who comes over to help you add
        all the needed functional parts to your car. Phew! The car is finally
        done, and it's time to show off!
      </p>

      <h2>Control flow and Loops</h2>
      <p>
        Control flow is how the computer runs the code from top to bottom in
        JavaScript. It nomally starts from the first line and ends at the last
        line. However, some statement can changes the control flow, such as
        conditionals, loops and functions.
      </p>
      <p>There is a interesting programmer joke:</p>
      <p>
        Wife: After you're done with work, make sure to buy a dozen of eggs. And
        if they have bread, go ahead and buy one.
      </p>
      <p>Husband: Alright.</p>
      <p>Later that night...</p>
      <p>Wife: Why did you only buy one egg?</p>
      <p>Husband: Well, I spotted they having bread, so...</p>
      <p>
        Lol! You may not understand why this husband does not follow his wife's
        instructions. First, let's find out what the conditional statement is.
        Conditional statements is used for determining whether or not pieces of
        code can run. In JavaScript, we have <code>if</code>,
        <code>else if</code>, <code>else</code> and
        <code>switch</code> statements.
      </p>
      <h3><code>if</code> statement</h3>
      <p>
        Let's putting the wife's instructions with <code>if</code> statement,
        you can see that:
      </p>
      <pre>

        let buyEggs = 12;
        let haveBread = true;

        if(haveBread){
          buyEggs = 1;
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        Wow! After this <code>if</code> statement, the <code>buyEggs</code> will
        return to 1 instead of 12. Because the condition
        <code>haveBread</code> is true and is used to specify execution for a
        block of code <code>buyEggs = 1;</code>. Now you may understand why the
        husband will only buy one egg. He must be a programmer!
      </p>
      <h3><code>if else</code> statement</h3>
      <p>
        Let's consider other conditional statements with the wife's different
        instructions for her programmer husband.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wife: go to the store and buy a dozen of eggs. If they have bread, buy
        one. If they do not have bread, buy extra a dozen of eggs.
      </p>
      <p>Following wife's instructions, here is the code:</p>
      <pre>

        let buyEggs = 12;
        let haveBread = true;

        if(haveBread){
          buyEggs = 1;
        }else{
          buyEggs += 12;
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        The husband will buy either 1 or 24 eggs based on whether the store has
        bread.
      </p>
      <h3><code>else if</code> statement and <code>switch</code> statement</h3>
      <p>
        The <code>else if</code> statement and the <code>switch</code> statement
        are similar in some ways, but they have distinct differences. The key
        distinction is that the <code>else if</code> statement allows for
        specifying a new condition to test if the previous condition evaluates
        to false. On the other hand, the <code>switch</code> statement is used
        to determine the matching expression among several possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        let's check wife's new instruction: go to the store and buy a dozen of
        eggs. If they have bread, buy one. If they have apples, buy five. If
        they do not have any, buy extra a dozen of eggs.
      </p>
      <p>Here is the code with <code>else if</code> statement:</p>
      <pre>

        let buyEggs = 12;
        let haveBread = true;
        let haveApple = ture;

        if(haveBread){
          buyEggs = 1;
        }else if(haveApple){
          buyEggs = 5;
        }else{
          buyEggs += 12;
        }
      </pre>
      <p>Here is the code with <code>switch</code> statement:</p>
      <pre>

        let buyEggs = 12;
        let haveBread = true;
        let haveApple = ture;

        switch(condision){
          case haveBread:
            buyEggs =  1;
            break;
          case haveApple:
            buyEggs =  5;
            break;
          default:
            buyEggs += 12;
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        The husband will buy either 1, 5 or 24 eggs based on what he seeing in
        the store. What a great husband!
      </p>
      <h3>Loops</h3>
      <p>
        Loops are one of the important control flows in JavaScript and can
        execute a block of cose a number of a times. It is similar to repeating
        a simple task for many times in the life. For example, you decide to
        serve 20 beautiful sunny side up eggs for your guests and you only have
        one pan, so you have to repeat the procedures: cracking the egg,
        pan-frying it, and serving it until you feed all the guests.
      </p>
      <p>If we put this example into JavaScript, the code will be liked:</p>
      <pre>

        for(let i = 0; i < 20; i++){
          text += egg[i] + " is done!" + &lt;br>;
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        The code above is using the <code>for</code> loops. There are threee
        expressions in side the parentheses:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Expression 1: <code>let i = 0;</code> is executed only one time
            before the execution of the code block. It likes a note to remind
            that you should start to cook the egg. But be careful, the computer
            program counts index starting from 0.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Expression 2: <code>i < 20;</code> definds the condition for
            executing the code block. It is an another note to remind you how
            many eggs you should cook.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Expression 3: <code>i++</code> is executed every time after the code
            block has been executed. It is a counter to count how many eggs have
            been cooked.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We have anothe way <code>while</code> to execute the loops.</p>
      <pre>

        let i = 0;
        while (i < 20){
          text += egg[i] + " is done!" + &lt;br>;
          i++;
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        The code in <code>while</code> loops will run over and over again until
        the variable <code>i</code> equals to 20. The <code>i</code> is a
        counter to remind you how many eggs have been cooked!
      </p>
      <h2>What is the DOM? How do we interact with it?</h2>
      <p>
        The DOM is from abbreviation of Document Object Model, a powerful tool
        and a programming interface for web documents. The programmers can use
        it to represent the web page so that programs can change the document
        structure, style and content.
      </p>
      <p>The HTML DOM is constructed as a tree of Objects:</p>
      <img
        src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/pic_htmltree.gif"
        alt="The HTML DOM picture"
      />
      <p>
        The reason why we should use DOM representation is because it allows us
        to manipulate the web page, and it can be modified with a scriping
        language such as JavaScript. For example, we can change the content of
        an element with an id:
      </p>

      <pre>

        &lt;html>
          &lt;body>
            &lt;p id = "example">&lt;/p>
            &lt;script>
              document.getElementById("examaple").innerHTML = "Hello!";
            &lt;/script>
          &lt;/body>
        &lt;/html>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Also, we can use many the DOM specified methods, such as
        <code>querySelector</code>, <code>getElementById</code>,
        <code>addEventListener()</code> and <code>createElement()</code> etc.
        The DOM is our useful tool in our learning journey!
      </p>

      <h2>The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h2>
      <h3>Objects</h3>
      <p>
        What are objects in JavaScript? They are mutable data structure in
        JavaScript to represent a thing, and it can be anything: a car, a
        person, a bird etc. We can store the data in key value pair. The key is
        itetable and can be anything. Here is the code how to create an object:
      </p>
      <pre>

        const person = {
          name: 'Yuekai Wu'
          age: '27'
          gender: 'male'
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        The way to access the value of the object is easy, we can either a dot
        operator followed by key name <code>person.name</code> or a square
        bracket along with key in string format <code>person['name']</code>.
      </p>
      <p>To modify the value to an object:</p>
      <pre>

        person.age = 28;
        //returns 28
      </pre>
      <p>To add a value to an object:</p>
      <pre>

        person.hobbies = 'Playing video game';
      </pre>
      <p>To delete a value from an object:</p>
      <pre>

        delete person.age;
      </pre>
      <h3>Arrays</h3>
      <p>
        Arrays are a kind of objects in JavaScript. They store the data in an
        ordered collection in which the data can be accessed using a numerical
        index. It is the major difference to the objects. They are also mutable
        and data can be modified at any index. However, we need to be careful
        that the indexes of arrays are zero based, meaning that the first item
        is stored in zero index, the second item at first index and so on. It is
        so different from our brain! Here is the code how to create an array:
      </p>
      <pre>

               //index [0][1][2][3][4][5]
        const number = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
      </pre>
      <p>To modufy the value of index '1' to an array:</p>
      <pre>

         number[1] = 10;
         //returns 10
      </pre>
      <p>To add a value to the front an array:</p>
      <pre>

        number.unshift(0);
      </pre>
      <p>To add a value to the end an array:</p>
      <pre>

        number.push(7);
      </pre>
      <p>To remove the value from an array:</p>
      <pre>

        delete number[3];
        //returns [1, 2, 3, undefined, 5, 6]
      </pre>
      <p>
        Be careful that removing the element form the array by
        <code>delete</code>, this method will replace the value with undefined
        instead of delete the index.
      </p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        If you want to store the data in oder or in a sequence, use arrays.
        Otherwise, just uss objects for everything else.
      </p>
      <h2>What are functions? Why are they helpful?</h2>
      <p>
        A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a
        particular task. To achieve this part, we need to declare a funtion:
      </p>
      <pre>

        function myAddingFunction(num1, num2){
          return num1 + num2;
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        The code above is defined with the <code>function</code> keyword and
        followed by a name <code>myAddingFunction</code>. Also, the followed
        parentheses include the parameters <code>num1</code> and
        <code>num2</code>. The code <code>return num1 + num2;</code> to be
        executed is place inside the curly brackets by the function.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may wonder that why the function has been declared, but there is
        nothing on the screen. It is simple, the function is only executed when
        you call it! How to call it? Let's check the code:
      </p>
      <pre>

        let number = myAddingFunction(65, 32);
        //return 97

        number = myAddingFunction(25, 32);
        //return 57
      </pre>
      <p>
        You can see that I just change the value of a parameter, and the element
        <code>number</code> will return to different value after it calls the
        function. The code in function will perform the adding task for
        <code>number</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's consider your washing machine. With it, you don't have to do much.
        Just put your clothes in and press the start button. The washing machine
        will take care of washing the clothes for you. Functions, once declared,
        can be called at any time and from anywhere you need them. They serve as
        a valuable tool that can save both your work and your life!
