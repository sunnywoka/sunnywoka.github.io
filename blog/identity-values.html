      <h2>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

      <p>
        Five years ago, I worked as a cafe manager. The cafe operated on a
        self-service basis, where customers would take their own food from the
        cabinet. One day, while I was on duty, a mother brought her young
        children to the cafe. In the queue before paying, she allowed her kids
        to start eating the sandwiches. This was against the cafe's policy.
        Unfortunately, the mother realized that she had forgotten her wallet,
        creating an awkward situation. The family had already consumed the food,
        and there was a long queue of customers behind them.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of my colleagues reported the situation to me. I knew that the store
        had a strict policy of not allowing customers to buy on credit. Since my
        boss was away, I had to make the decision myself. After a brief
        consideration, I chose to let the family go and decided to cover their
        bill. The mother appreciated my gesture and promised to return the next
        day to pay. However, at the end of the day, my boss criticized me for
        breaking the policy, as he believed it could have a negative impact on
        other customers who might want to pay on credit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fortunately, the mother returned and transferred the money to me later.
        I believed that my decision prevented the family from continuously
        feeling awkward in front of other customers, streamlined the workflow,
        and minimized my boss's loss. While I understood my boss's perspective,
        I felt that helping individuals in need was more important than rigidly
        adhering to the policy. If I were to encounter a similar situation
        again, I would make the same decision as I did five years ago, as I
        believe it was the best solution in that particular circumstance.

        When I was 16 years old, I relocated to New Zealand. Prior to that, I
        had a traditional Chinese mindset, which included values like respecting
        elders. However, after moving to New Zealand, I discovered that I truly
        enjoyed the freedom and the concept of equality that exists here. I even
        became friends with Mark, who used to be my English tutor. This
        experience had a profound impact on my personality, making me more
        open-minded, understanding and respecting the differences between
        individuals.

      <p>
        I am a fast learner, and good at grasping challenging concepts and
        drawing connections to other cases based on a single instance. I think
        my strengths will support doing well in my learning journey.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?

      <p>
        I struggle with laziness and easily get distracted byvideo games. My
        time management skills also are poor. They can easily disrupt my study
        plan, so I have to devise strategies to overcome these challenges.
        Otherwise, I will struggle to complete my work on time.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.

        When I was in university, one of our final group projects involved
        creating a 3D game. Our goal was to replicate the drifting capability
        found in Mario Kart. However, it proved to be much more challenging than
        we had anticipated, and we became stuck on this aspect for over two
        weeks. We attempted two strategies: searching for resources online and
        exploring existing packages in Unity. Unfortunately, we didn't find a
        significant amount of information specifically related to the drifting
        capability we desired. However, we were fortunate enough to discover a
        suitable package that allowed us to achieve our goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, our game received positive feedback from both lecturers and
        fellow students. If I were to encounter a similar situation again, I
        believe I would seek help from the community of peers and facilitators
        at Dev Academy. I have come to realize that reaching out for assistance
        is more effective and contributes to my ability to listen to others and
        enhance my skills.
